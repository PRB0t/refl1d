"""
This module runs the Refl1D Reflectometry Modeler application in GUI mode.
It creates the initial wxPython frame, presents a splash screen to the user,
and then constructs the rest of the GUI.

From the command line, the application can be run as follows:

$ python reflgui [<optional parameters>]

The following is a list of command line parameters for development and
debugging purposes.  None are documented and they may change at any time.

Options for showing diagnostic info:
    --platform      Display platform specific info, especially about fonts
    --syspath       Display the contents of sys.path
    --time          Display diagnostic timing information

Options for overriding the default font and point size attributes where
parameters within each set are mutually exclusive (last one takes precedence):
    --arial, --tahoma, --verdana
    --6pt, --7pt, --8pt, --9pt, --10pt, --11pt, --12pt

Options for controlling the development and testing environment:
    --inspect       Run the wxPython Widget Inspection Tool in a debug window
