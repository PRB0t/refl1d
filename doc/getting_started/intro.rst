Refl1D - an overview
####################


1-D reflectometry modeling allows material scientists to understand the
structure of thin films.  1-D models give the depth profile for material 
scattering density composed of a mixture of flat and continuously 
varying freeform layers. With polarized neutron measurements, scientists 
can study the sub-surface structure of magnetic samples. The architecture 
supports the addition of specialized layer types such as models for the 
density distribution of polymer brushes, and volume space modeling for 
proteins in bio-membranes. We will provide a number of these models as 
well as supporting user defined layer types for both structural and 
magnetic scattering densities.

Refl1D provides multiple ways of creating and adjusting the model,
and simultaneously showing the degree of fit between the 
experimental data and the theoretical data graphically. 
This package comes with an optimization algorithm which 
adjusts the variables of the model yielding the best fit to the data.
