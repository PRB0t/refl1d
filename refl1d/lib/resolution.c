The resolution function returns the convolution of the reflectometry
curve with a Q-dependent gaussian.

We provide the following function:
   resolution(Nin, Qin, Rin, N, Q, dQ, R)  returns convolution
   resolution_padding(step,dQ)             returns \#points (see below)

where
   Nin is the number of theory points
   Qin,Rin are the computed theory points
   N is the number of Q points to calculate
   Q are the locations of the measured data points
   dQ are the width (sigma) of the convolution at each measured point
   R is the returned convolution.

Note that FWHM = sqrt(8 ln 2) dQ, so scale dQ appropriately.

The contribution of Q to a resolution of width dQo at point Qo is:

   p(Q) = 1/sqrt(2 pi dQo^2) exp ( (Q-Qo)^2/(2 dQo^2) )

We are approximating the convolution at Qo using a numerical
approximation to the integral over the measured points.  For 
efficiency, the integral is limited to p(Q_i)/p(0)>=0.001.  

Note that the function we are convoluting is falling off as Q^4.
That means the correct convolution should uniformly sample across
the entire width of the Gaussian.  This is not possible at the
end points unless you calculate the reflectivity beyond what is
strictly needed for the data. The function resolution_pad(dQ,step) 
returns the number of additional steps of size step required to 
go beyond this limit for the given width dQ.  This occurs when:

    (n*step)^2 < -2 dQ^2 * ln 0.001

The choice of sampling density is particularly important near the 
critical edge.  This is where the resolution calculation has the 
largest effect on the reflectivity curve. In one particular model, 
calculating every 0.001 rather than every 0.02 changed one value 
above the critical edge by 15%.  This is likely to be a problem for 
any system with a well defined critical edge.  The solution is to
compute the theory function over a finer mesh where the derivative
is changing rapidly.  For the critical edge, I have found a sampling
density of 0.005 to be good enough.

For systems involving thick layers, the theory function oscillates 
rapidly around the measured points.  This is a problem when the
period of the oscillation, 2 pi/d for total sample depth d, is on
the order of the width of the resolution function. This is true even 
for gradually changing profiles in materials with very high roughness
values.  In these systems, the theory function should be oversampled
around the measured points Q.  With a single thick layer, oversampling
can be limited to just one period.  With multiple thick layers,
oscillations will show interference patterns and it will be necessary 
to oversample uniformly between the measured points.  When oversampled
spacing is less than about 2 pi/7 d, it is possible to see aliasing
effects.  

FIXME is it better to use random sampling or strictly
regular spacing when you are undersampling?

   to use the inner limits rather than the outer limits, but this will
   still break down if the Q spacing is approximately equal to limit.
